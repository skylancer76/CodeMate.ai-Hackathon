# Frontend Setup

## Installation

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

## Running the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

## Important Notes

- Make sure the Python backend is running on `http://localhost:8000` before starting the frontend
- The terminal connects to the backend API for real command execution
- All commands are processed by the Python backend using your actual file system
